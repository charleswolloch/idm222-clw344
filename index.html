                <div class="intro">
                <p>Hello! I'm Charles, a designer and creator of many things, digital and physical. I am a current undergrad student at Drexel University pursuing my Bachelors of Science In Interactive Digital Media. Through my major I have worked hard to pick up the many skills that I can use to great ability today. I have experience in prototyping for apps and websites as well as in physical prototyping. My drive for creating neat new projects is what lead me to my current program and major. </p>
            
                <p>I also have had 3 total Internship experiences with Salesforce totaling 9 months together. Through these experiences I have learned a lot about the corporate world and the Salesforce Eco system among other things. I am a hands on learner and metric-driven person so I love to see my results however I love to solve challenges over time, after all Rome wasnâ€™t built in a day.</p>
            
        
            
                <p>Personally I am an avid lover of musical theater, prototyping for fun, and video games. I like to think that all of my interests bleed into my work. Through my love of theater and acting I learned that I love any performance, much to say that I treat all presentations like a performance. I put my all into every time I stand in front of a group presenting my work. Through my love for prototyping I have learned new ways of making fun creative objects for my every day use. For example an automatic air freshener using an Arduino, motor, and IR break beam sensor. Through my love of video games I have an appreciation for gamification and the visual arts. Much of what is seen on the screen at any time like an ordinary website can be seen for much more, for example the immense effort and thought process that went into creating such site. </p>
                    
        
            
                <p>As I continue my undergrad experience I am excited to learn new skills. I am most excited to learn HTML and CSS among a few other coding languages so I can start freelancing work on my own. Thank you for taking the time to read about me and I hope you have a good day, <br> Charles </p>
